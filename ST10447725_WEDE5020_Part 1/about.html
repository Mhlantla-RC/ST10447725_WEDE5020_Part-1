                    <h3>Our Journey & What Drives Us</h3>
                    <p>The Odd Jobbers was founded in 2025 out of a simple observation: many people need help with small, often overlooked tasks like moving a couch, delivering a parcel, or picking up a bulky purchase. We started as a community-driven initiative, connecting neighbours with reliable individuals, and quickly grew into a platform dedicated to efficiency and trust.</p>
                    <p>Our mission is to simplify everyday logistics by providing a seamless and reliable platform that connects individuals and businesses with skilled local "jobbers" for their moving and delivery needs. We envision a community where help is always just a click away, fostering local economic activity and making life easier for everyone.</p>
